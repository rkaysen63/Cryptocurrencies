* Tools: 
  * Python (Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, hvplot.pandas, plotly.express, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.decomposition, sklearn.cluster)

## Overview:
* The purpose of this analysis of cryptocurrency data to determine which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped.  
* The analysis will be performed using unsupervised machine learning models.  
* The data will be preprocessed to clean the data set, to reduce it to only cryptocurrencies that are traded, create numeric variables for features, and the features scaled.  
* Then 98 features will be reduced to three principal components using sklearn.decomposition.PCA in order to visualize in three dimensions.  
* The cryptocurrencies will be clustered using sklearn.cluster.KMeans.
* The results will be tabularized and visualized through scatter plots.

### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA 
* Perform 5 preprocessing steps on the crypto_df DataFrame:
  * All cryptocurrencies that are not being traded are removed (3 pt)
  * The IsTrading column is dropped (3 pt)
  * All the rows that have at least one null value are removed (3 pt)
  * All the rows that do not have coins being mined are removed (3 pt)
  * The CoinName column is dropped (3 pt)
* A new DataFrame is created that stores all cryptocurrency names from the CoinName column and retains the index from the crypto_df DataFrame (5 pt)
* The get_dummies() method is used to create variables for the text features, which are then stored in a new DataFrame, X (5 pt)
* The features from the X DataFrame have been standardized using the StandardScaler fit_transform() function (5 pt)

### Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* The PCA algorithm reduces the dimensions of the X DataFrame down to three principal components (10 pt)
* The pcs_df DataFrame is created and has the following three columns, PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3, and has the index from the crypto_df DataFrame (10 pt)

### Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk.  Complete all requirements below:

* The K-means algorithm is used to cluster the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data, where the following steps have been completed:
  * An elbow curve is created using hvPlot to find the best value for K (10 pt)
  * Predictions are made on the K clusters of the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data (5 pt)
  * A new DataFrame is created with the same index as the crypto_df DataFrame and has the following columns: Algorithm, ProofType, TotalCoinsMined, TotalCoinSupply, PC 1, PC 2, PC 3, CoinName, and Class (5 pt)

### Deliverable 4: 
* The clusters are plotted using a 3D scatter plot, and each data point shows the CoinName and Algorithm on hover (10 pt)
* A table with tradable cryptocurrencies is created using the hvplot.table() function (3 pt)
* The total number of tradable cryptocurrencies is printed (2 pt)
* A DataFrame is created that contains the clustered_df DataFrame index, the scaled data, and the CoinName and Class columns (5 pt)
* A hvplot scatter plot is created where the X-axis is "TotalCoinsMined", the Y-axis is "TotalCoinSupply", the data is ordered by "Class", and it shows the CoinName when you hover over the data point (10 pt)
